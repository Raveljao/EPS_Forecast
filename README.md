# EPS_Forecast: Financial Prediction Using AI

## Overview
This project explores the use of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to predict **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** for companies. It focuses on applying various AI models to financial data to enhance the accuracy of financial forecasts.

## Project Structure
- **Introduction**: Context and justification for using AI in financial predictions.
- **Literature Review**: Overview of fundamental financial concepts and existing prediction models.
- **Methodology**: Detailed explanation of data selection, preprocessing, and the AI models used.
- **Data Analysis and Experimentation**: Analysis of the data and results from applying different AI models.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of findings, discussion, and future recommendations.

## AI Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Key Findings
- The **Random Forest** model, trained on a sample of 30 companies, showed the best performance with an average **F1 score of 74%**.
- No clear link was found between the model used, sample size, and prediction performance.

## Future Work
- Further experimentation with **larger datasets** and different AI models.
- Exploration of additional **financial indicators** for improved prediction accuracy.
