# EPS_Forecast: Financial Prediction Using AI

## Overview
This project explores the use of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to predict **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Variation** for companies. It focuses on applying various AI models to financial data to enhance the accuracy of financial forecasts.

## Project Structure

### Introduction
The project explores the use of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** in financial predictions, particularly focusing on **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**. The motivation stems from the potential to improve financial forecasting accuracy using AI tools.

### Literature Review
This section covers fundamental financial concepts such as **cash flows**, **income statements**, and **balance sheets**. It also reviews existing financial prediction models and their applications.

### Methodology
The research involves:
- Selecting relevant financial data
- Preprocessing the data
- Applying AI models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict EPS.

### Data Analysis and Experimentation
The analysis includes testing different AI models on historical financial data of **45 French companies**. The **Random Forest** model showed the most promising results with an average **F1 score of 74%**.

### Conclusion
The findings indicate that while AI models can enhance financial predictions, further experimentation is needed. Recommendations for future research are provided.


## AI Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Key Findings
- The **Random Forest** model, trained on a sample of 30 companies, showed the best performance with an average **F1 score of 74%**.
- No clear link was found between the model used, sample size, and prediction performance.

## Future Work
- Further experimentation with **larger datasets** and different AI models.
- Exploration of additional **financial indicators** for improved prediction accuracy.
